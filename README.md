🚀 Data Structures Mini Projects (Python)
This repository contains three Python projects that demonstrate core data structures (Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, and Deques) in practical real-world scenarios.

📂 Projects
1. 🚗 Smart Parking Lot

Description:
A parking lot simulation using a singly linked list. Cars are added to the parking lot until it reaches full capacity. Cars can also exit, and the system dynamically updates available slots.

Features:

Park cars until capacity is reached.

Prevents overflow (parking beyond capacity).

Remove a specific car by its number.

Display currently parked cars.

2. 🚆 Virtual Train Route

Description:
A train route simulation using a doubly linked list. The program supports both linear routes and circular metro routes, allowing forward/backward navigation between stations.

Features:

Add stations dynamically.

Choose between linear or circular routes.

Move train forward ⏩ or backward ⏪.

3. 💬 Message History Manager

Description:
A simple chat/message system that uses queue, stack, and deque concepts. Messages can be sent, undone, and redone, mimicking chat history management.

Features:

Send messages with timestamps.

Undo the last message (removes it from chat).

Redo the last undone message.

View full chat history.

Show the full route.

Show the current station.

📖 Concepts Covered

Linked Lists (singly & doubly linked)

Stacks (LIFO) – Undo/Redo functionality

Queues (FIFO) – Message handling

Deques – Efficient double-ended queue
